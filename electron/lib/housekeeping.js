//                                                     updater produces on every update.
//   %TEMP%\nsXXXX.tmp\                         451 MB  full install: `app-64.7z` plus the payload it
//                                                     unpacked into `7z-out\`

// lives in a pure function that can be tested. The runner is best-effort: a file that fails to delete
// is retried on the next launch, while the app must stay open.
//
// DELIBERATELY does not import 'electron': all paths come in as parameters, so its tests run on plain Node.
