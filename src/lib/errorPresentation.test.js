// PLAY's visibility rule. It is not "did the store load" — an expired API token is
// the ordinary result of Riot rotating sessions, and the saved Riot Client
// credentials a switch writes are a different store entirely, so such an account can
// still be switched to and launched. What rules PLAY out is an entry that is
// unusable AS AN ENTRY: one pointing at another entry's account, or one whose files
// could not be read at all.
//
// This rule had to be pinned down because the first version hid PLAY behind
// `status === 'error'`, and on a real machine every account sat in that state — zero
// controls rendered from a build that was otherwise correct.
