// Whether the PLAY control may be used for one account row, and what it should say.
//
// Rewritten after a real test: the first version refused the press unless the account was ALREADY
// signed in, because a client that is not signed in accepts a launch request and then drops it — true,
// but the wrong conclusion, and it muted the button on every row a manager actually holds. The client
// will not launch while somebody else is signed in, but it will be switched first, which this app
// already does, so PLAY switches and then launches. The gate asks one question, not two: can this
// ENTRY be used at all? An entry pointing at another entry's account, or one whose files could not be
// read, cannot be switched and so cannot be launched either. Everything else can, signed in or not.
